# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `SubcellOccupancyGrid` for deterministic slot-based crowding on top of coarse cell blockers, including `bestSlotForUnit()`, `occupy()`, and `neighborsWithSpace()` for smaller-than-cell unit packing.
- `OccupancyBinding` for higher-level passability ownership: blocker metadata (`building` / `resource` / `unit` etc.), destroy-time lifecycle cleanup via `world.onDestroy()`, optional sub-cell crowding, crowding-aware `isBlocked()` path queries, and a `GridPassability`-compatible surface that plugs directly into `findGridPath()`.
- `getMetrics()` / `resetMetrics()` on `OccupancyGrid` and `SubcellOccupancyGrid`, plus occupancy-cost reporting in `npm run benchmark:rts`.

### Documentation

- Updated the README, architecture notes, API reference, RTS primitives guide, and sub-grid movement guide to document the higher-level occupancy binding and the new occupancy benchmark metrics.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-12

This release addresses six ergonomics friction points identified by game projects consuming the engine. All changes are additive and backwards-compatible.

### Breaking Changes

- `WorldSnapshot` is now version 4 and includes `state`, `tags`, and `metadata` fields. Version 1-3 snapshots still load for compatibility.
- `TickDiff` now includes `state`, `tags`, and `metadata` fields.

### Added

- **Loose system typing:** `LooseSystem` and `LooseSystemRegistration` types allow systems typed against bare `World` or `World<any, any>` to be registered without casts into generic worlds. `registerSystem` accepts both strict and loose system types via overloads.
- **Typed component registry:** Optional third type parameter `TComponents` on `World<TEventMap, TCommandMap, TComponents>`. When provided, `getComponent`, `setComponent`, `addComponent`, `patchComponent`, `removeComponent`, and `query` infer types from component keys. Falls back to the existing string-based API when omitted.
- **World-level state store:** `setState(key, value)`, `getState(key)`, `deleteState(key)`, `hasState(key)` for non-entity structured state (terrain config, simulation parameters, etc.). Included in serialization and diffs. JSON-compatible values only.
- **Spatial query helpers:** `queryInRadius(cx, cy, radius, ...components)` combines spatial proximity with component filtering. `findNearest(cx, cy, ...components)` returns the closest entity matching all components.
- **System ordering constraints:** `SystemRegistration.before` and `SystemRegistration.after` accept arrays of system names. Constraints resolve via topological sort within each phase. Cycles, cross-phase constraints, and missing name references throw descriptive errors. Order re-resolves when systems are added dynamically.
- **Entity tags:** `addTag`, `removeTag`, `hasTag`, `getByTag` (reverse-indexed), `getTags`. Multiple entities can share a tag. Tags cleaned up on entity destruction, included in serialization and diffs.
- **Entity metadata:** `setMeta`, `getMeta`, `deleteMeta`, `getByMeta` (unique reverse-indexed). Designed for external IDs and stable gameplay IDs. Metadata cleaned up on entity destruction, included in serialization and diffs.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-10

This release hardens the engine API and package boundary while adding RTS-scale primitives, render/debug infrastructure, and a browser reference debug client for reusable 2D civilization simulation projects.

### Breaking Changes

- Resource pools now use `max: null` for unbounded capacity instead of `Infinity`.
- Component data must be JSON-compatible. Components containing `undefined`, non-finite numbers, functions, symbols, bigints, class instances, or circular references are rejected.
- Component and resource writes through `World` now validate entity liveness and throw for dead or never-created entities.
- Position writes validate integer grid bounds before mutating component state.
- `WorldSnapshot` is now version 3 and includes resource state plus deterministic RNG state. Version 1 and 2 snapshots still load for compatibility.

### Added

- `EntityRef`, `world.getEntityRef(id)`, and `world.isCurrent(ref)` for stale-reference checks across recycled entity IDs.
- `world.setComponent()`, `world.patchComponent()`, and `world.setPosition()` as explicit write APIs.
- In-place component mutation detection for tick diffs.
- Read-only `world.grid` view, while `SpatialGrid` remains available as a standalone utility.
- Resource store snapshot state, including registrations, pools, rates, transfers, and next transfer ID.
- `world.random()` and `WorldConfig.seed` for deterministic pseudo-random simulation logic.
- Phase-aware system registration with `input`, `preUpdate`, `update`, `postUpdate`, and `output` phases.
- `world.getMetrics()` for per-tick timing, query cache, system, and spatial sync instrumentation.
- `WorldConfig.detectInPlacePositionMutations` and `world.markPositionDirty()` for large simulations that want to avoid the compatibility full-scan spatial sync path.
- `OccupancyGrid` for deterministic blocked-cell, footprint, occupancy, and reservation tracking.
- `findGridPath`, `PathCache`, `PathRequestQueue`, and `createGridPathQueue` for RTS-scale deterministic grid path processing.
- `VisibilityMap` for per-player visible and explored cell tracking.
- `RenderAdapter` for renderer-facing projected snapshots and diffs with generation-aware entity refs.
- `WorldDebugger` plus occupancy, visibility, and path queue probe helpers for headless inspection.
- Machine-readable `WorldDebugger.issues` alongside compatibility `warnings`.
- `world.submitWithResult()`, structured validator rejections, and command-result listeners.
- `CommandExecutionResult`, `world.onCommandExecution()`, and submission-sequence tracking so queued commands can be matched to tick-time execution or failure.
- `WorldHistoryRecorder` for short-horizon command outcomes and tick history capture.
- `TickFailure`, `WorldStepResult`, `WorldTickFailureError`, `world.stepWithResult()`, and `world.getLastTickFailure()` for structured runtime failure handling without forcing AI loops through thrown exceptions.
- `WorldDebugger.tickFailure` plus machine-readable runtime error issues derived from the latest failed tick.
- `WorldHistoryRecorder` capture for command execution results and tick failures, plus range summaries that aggregate execution outcomes and failure codes.
- Explicit AI contract version exports plus `schemaVersion` markers on command outcomes, debugger snapshots, history state, and scenario results.
- `summarizeWorldHistoryRange()` for AI-facing tick-window summaries over command outcomes, changed entities, events, and issues.
- `runScenario()` for headless setup, scripted stepping, checks, and structured AI-facing results.
- A browser debug client example backed by a worker-owned simulation, `RenderAdapter`, and `WorldDebugger`.
- `npm run benchmark:rts` for deterministic RTS-scale benchmark scenarios and metrics output.
- Runtime validation for world config, game-loop config, resource amounts/rates/maxima, and spatial coordinates.
- `ClientAdapter` runtime message guarding, structured `commandAccepted`/`commandRejected` outcomes, and optional `onError` callback for send failures.
- `ClientAdapter` streaming for `commandExecuted`, `commandFailed`, and `tickFailed` messages so remote agents can distinguish queued commands from executed commands and read structured tick failures.
- Client protocol version markers on server message envelopes.
- Tick-budget metrics plus `tick-budget-exceeded` debugger issues with slow-system context.
- `InstrumentationProfile` and `WorldConfig.instrumentationProfile` with `full`, `minimal`, and `release` modes for development, QA/staging, and shipping runtime overhead control.
- Lazy command execution feedback allocation so runtime execution results are only built when listeners are attached.
- Root package export barrel, declaration build config, npm package metadata, and CI workflow.
